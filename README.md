# How does PCA work? Retaining values while reducing dimension
PCA (principal component analysis compresses any initial dataset with x amount of attributes into a smaller one; all data points are first plotted in a x by x (length number of attributes) sized covariance matrix where eigenvectors and eigenvalues are calculated for each column of the matrix-- the top y number of eigenvalues are retained based on user-input compression value. If opting to keep only 2 eigenvalues, we can plot the results on a 2D plane
